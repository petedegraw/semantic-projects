<h2 id="wordpress-installation">Wordpress Installation</h2>
<p>In order to install Wordpress, please follow detailed instructions in <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress#Detailed_Instructions">Wordpress official codex</a>.</p>
<h2 id="theme-installation">Theme Installation</h2>
<p>To install the theme, you should already have a working version of WordPress.</p>
<p>First, extract the zipped package downloaded from ThemeForest to your chosen folder. In the extracted package, you should find <strong>appic.zip</strong> which is the WordPress theme file.</p>
<p>So, there are two ways of theme installation - via <strong>Wordpress Admin panel</strong> and via <strong>FTP</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="admin-panel">Admin Panel</h3>
<p>In Wordpress <strong>Admin panel</strong>, navigate to <strong>Appearance > Themes</strong> in the left sidebar. On the top of the page there will be a link <strong>Add New</strong>, click on that link and after you get on <strong>Install Themes</strong> page, click <strong>Upload</strong> link. Select <code>appic.zip</code> file and press <strong>Install Now</strong> button. As soon as your theme is installed, you should see an <strong>Activate</strong> link. Click on it. Hurrah! Your Appic theme is now successfully activated.</p>
<h3 id="ftp">FTP</h3>
<p>Using FTP, extract your <code>appic.zip</code> file and upload the extracted folder to <code>/wp-content/themes/</code> folder on your server. Now you have to activate the theme. To do that, go to Wordpress <strong>Admin panel</strong> and navigate to <strong>Appearance > Themes</strong> in the left sidebar. On the loaded page, find your <strong>Appic</strong> theme image, hover over it and press <strong>Activate</strong> button. The theme is now activated.</p>
<h2 id="make-your-theme-look-like-our-live-demo">Make your Theme Look like our Live Demo</h2>
<p>To make your Appic theme look like our live demo, please follow instructions described in the next steps. Please <em>NOTE</em>, images from our live demo will not be imported. They are under a license and therefore are replaced with placeholders. You can replace those in the respective locations. For example, you would to update a post image. To do this, open this post in the Editor and in the right sidebar find <strong>Featured Image</strong> link to upload a different picture.</p>
<h3 id="i-install-recommended-plugins">I. Install Recommended Plugins</h3>
<p>You should see a notice on the top in Wordpress Admin panel (of course, if you do not have these plugins activated yet). You should run through installation and activation of those, if you want your theme function as our live demo does. Particularly important is enabling <strong>Contact Form 7</strong> plugin before the next step. When you activate these plugins, you most probably will see notices from Revolution Slider and WMPL. We advise you not to follow them at this point and return to them later.</p>
<h3 id="ii-permalinks-structure">II. Permalinks Structure</h3>
<p>To make your page links SEO-friendly, in Admin panel navigate to <strong>Settings > Permalinks</strong> and select <strong>Post name</strong>, now click <strong>Save changes</strong></p>
<img src="img/permalinks.png" class="img-polaroid">

<p>To start, in Wordpress Admin panel go to <strong>Tools > Import</strong> in the left sidebar. On the loaded page, click on <strong>Wordpress</strong> link. This way the Wordpress importer plugin is installed. Now select <code>sample-data.xml</code> file found in Sample Data folder of your unzipped Appic package and press <strong>Upload file and import</strong>. Within a few minutes, you should have your demo data imported.

<h3 id="vi-setting-up-home-page">VI. Setting Up Home page</h3>
<p>In order to set up the Home page, go to <strong>Settings > Reading</strong> in the Admin panel. Tick <strong>A static page (select below)</strong> for <strong>Front page displays</strong> option. In the first select box, choose <strong>Home</strong> and in the second box choose <strong>Blog</strong>.</p>
<img src="img/setting-up-homepage.png" class="img-polaroid">
<p>There are two available templates for Home page, including one template with <strong>Action block</strong> and the second one with two different <strong>Revolution Sliders</strong> at your choice. The current Home page uses the Actions block template. To set up the Action block go to <strong>Appearance > Theme Options > Home > Action Block</strong>. </p>
<img src="img/home-page-settings.png" class="img-polaroid">
<p>If you decide to change the Home page template to one with the slider, go to <strong>Pages > All Pages</strong> and search for <strong>Home</strong>. Click on the edit link and in right sidebar select the option <strong>Home - Revo Slider</strong>. Also, in the content area search for <code>overlay="yes"</code> and relace with <code>overlay="no"</code>, now the promobox will not overlay the previous layer. Click <strong>Update</strong>.

<img src="img/home-revo-template.png" class="img-polaroid">
<h3 id="vii-setting-up-revolution-slider">VII. Setting Up Revolution Slider</h3>
<p>We assume you have followed all the steps above, and so by this time you should have the <strong>Revolution Slider</strong> plugin installed and activated. To set up the Revolution sliders as they appear on our live demo, in Admin panel, go to Revolution Slider tab and on the opened page look for green <strong>Import</strong> button located in the top right corner.</p>
<img src="img/revo-import-button.png" class="img-polaroid">
<p>Press this button and in the popup window select <strong>home-revo-1.zip</strong> from Sample data folder in your unzipped theme package and press <strong>Import Slider</strong>. Hurray! The slider is there.

<h3 id="viii-setting-up-blog-page">VIII. Setting Up Blog page</h3>

Now your widgets are set up.</p>
<img src="img/import-widgets.png" class="img-polaroid">

<p>If you would like to know more about plugins used in the widget areas, please go the <strong>Recommended Plugins</strong> section.</p>
<p>You've done a great job! Congratulations on setting up your Appic theme.</p>
<h2 id="theme-options-1">Theme Options</h2>
<p>There are many settings for Appic theme available that you can find in Admin Panel at <strong>Appearance > Theme Options</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="shortcodes">Shortcodes</h2>
<p>Appic Wordpress theme provides you with over 50 custom shortcodes. Additionaly, you may want to use <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/shortcodes/">Wordpress built-in shortcodes</a>.  To insert a shortcode, you should first create a page. To do this, go to <strong>Pages</strong> tab in the left sidebar in Admin panel and in the dropdown menu select <strong>Add New</strong>. In the top bar, just above the text area box, there is a Shortcodes icon. Click on it and select your desired shortcode.</p>
<img src="img/shortcodes.png" class="img-polaroid">
<p>You may find it difficult to use some of these shortcodes. Therefore, the most complex are described below.</p>
<h3 id="grid">Grid</h3>
<p>The Appic layout is built on <strong>Bootstrap 2.3</strong> grid system. This means that the content area is divided on 12 columns, making total width of 940px. So, first you should select a <strong>Row</strong> shortcode (Grid > Row) and inside row tags <code>[row][/row]</code> insert a column shortcode (Grid > Column ...). For example, you want the content to be divided into three columns (3/12 of the content width, then 6/12 and then again 3/12). The code representing this content layout is shown below:</p>
<pre><code>[row][column_3][/column_3][column_6][/column_6][column_3][/column_3][/row]
</code></pre>
<p>You should remember that the sum of numbers in the end of columns should always equal 12. Alternatively, you may want to use offsett Bootstrap classes, so your code can be modified as follows:</p>
<pre><code>[row][column_3][/column_3][column_3 class="offset6"][/column_3][/row]
</code></pre>
<p>To the sum of column numbers, add the number in the end of offset class. This sum should also equal 12. For detailed information on Grid system and Bootstrap classes, please refer to <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/scaffolding.html#gridSystem">Bootstrap official documentation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="pricing-tables">Pricing Tables</h3>
<p>You may find <strong>Pricing Tables</strong> shortcode a little complicated. When you insert this shortcode (<strong>Shortcodes > Elements > Pricing tables > 4 columns</strong>), the code pasted into your content area is as following:</p>
<pre><code>[pricing_table columns="4"][pricing_column title="Title" price="$ 0.00" button_text="Purchase" button_url="#"][pricing_item]Parameter 1[/pricing_item][pricing_item]Parameter 2[/pricing_item][/pricing_column][pricing_column title="Title" title_class="" price="$ 0.00" button_text="Purchase" button_url="#" button_class=""][pricing_item]Parameter 1[/pricing_item][pricing_item]Parameter 2[/pricing_item][/pricing_column][/pricing_table]
</code></pre>
<p>To clarify a little bit: <code>[pricing_table][/pricing_table]</code> is the container for pricing columns. Pricing columns are marked as <code>[pricing_column][/pricing_column]</code> and serve as container for rows of information marked as <code>[pricing_item][pricing_item]</code>. By default, two pricing columns are inserted, one standard and one premium. Depending on how many columns you choose, you can append before the ending tag <code>[/pricing_table]</code> one, two or three additional pricing columns.</p>
<h3 id="table">Table</h3>
<p>Shortcode <strong>Table</strong> is located at <strong>Shortcodes > Elements > Table</strong>. The code inserted into the content area is as following:</p>
<pre><code>[table][head][table_row][column]Title 1[/column][column]Title 2[/column][column]Title 3[/column][column]Title 4[/column][column]Title 5[/column][/table_row][/head][body][table_row][column]1[/column][column]2[/column][column]3[/column][column]4[/column][column]5[/column][/table_row][table_row][column]1[/column][column]2[/column][column]3[/column][column]4[/column][column]5[/column][/table_row][/body][/table]
</code></pre>
<p>This shortcode will draw a table of three rows and five columns. If you would like to append an additional column, then add <code>[column][/column]</code> before all closing tags <code>[/table_row]</code>. If you would like to add an additional row, just add <code>[table_row]([column][/column] * your number of columns)[/table_row]</code> before the closing tag <code>[/body]</code>.</p>
<h2 id="custom-post-types-1">Custom Post Types</h2>
<p>There are four custom post types that go with Appic theme:</p>
<ul>
<li>Services</li>
<li>Testimonials</li>
<li>Portfolio</li>
<li>Team</li>
</ul>
<img src="img/custom-post-types.png" class="img-polaroid">
